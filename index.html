  <h1>Ethics, Systems & Culture</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Welcome from Krishna Vas Azimera</h2>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome! I’m <strong>Krishna Vas Azimera</strong>, an aspiring IT Supervisor with a focus on ethical leadership, systems thinking, and culturally adaptive management. This section of my ISR Web Portfolio highlights my competencies in navigating ethical dilemmas, leading with integrity, and adapting to diverse professional environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world of information technology is not just about tools and systems—it's about people, values, and vision. I created this section to showcase how I intend to lead in modern IT settings while aligning with U.S. workplace expectations. Thank you for visiting.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      IT Supervisors in the U.S. must lead ethically, think systemically, and navigate cultural diversity. In this assignment, I demonstrate my ability to respond to ethical dilemmas, apply systems thinking to leadership, and adjust my management style to fit the American workplace culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio section includes the following components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ethical Dilemma Response</strong> – A real-world leadership decision involving data integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Causal Loop Diagram</strong> – A systems-thinking visual showing the relationship between feedback and team productivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Code of Ethics</strong> – My values and principles that shape professional behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural Adaptation Reflection</strong> – How I will align my leadership with U.S. norms.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Loop Name:</strong> Supervisor Clarity and Performance Loop<br><br>
      <strong>Variables:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Supervisor Feedback Clarity</li>
        <li>Team Understanding of Goals</li>
        <li>Task Accuracy</li>

    <div class="explanation">
      <strong>Loop Explanation:</strong>
      <p>When a supervisor provides clear and consistent feedback, the team better understands expectations.</p>
      <p>This leads to fewer mistakes and more accurate task execution, which improves overall productivity.</p>
      <p>Higher productivity builds trust between the supervisor and team, leading to even more open communication—creating a reinforcing feedback loop.</p>
